> Companies listed are all based on what I have heard of. Advice is to gauge the companies during interview session. Ask more questions about:
- company culture
- what is an intern's job scope
- the mentorship provided.
- onboarding for new comers

> Do not join if no interviewer can define what is a data analyst, data scientist well, which likely means the company is not clear of the job content.
